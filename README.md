# Diagrams 
**Conceptual Diagram** 

This is the conceptual diagram that I initially created. As I recreated the diagram in the program, I remodeled it. Instead of there being three Entities, there are now only two. I was debating about the use of two within my blog and ultimately decided it would be unnecessary. Instead I have both a Student and a Course entity, which have a one to many relationship (one student typically has several courses to take.

**Logical Diagram**

This is the logical diagram I created. I wanted to have a field to be able to identify a student, so I chose the student id and the name. I also wanted to know what degree the student is in and what their courses look like. That's why I chose to focus on these two specificallyw when I recreated my diagrams.

**Physical Diagram**
I initially had both the student and course diagrams in a relationship with the degree diagram, but I feel like that was wrap around logic. I was having trouble getting this to run until I got rid of my degree diagram. Although with the end factor, I don't believe my diagrams have a relationship now.
